# DR-421

The request was:

```
There's a folder in Google Drive ( Caltech FOLIO migration > coral_licensing-2021-09-16 > documents) that contains all the documents from CORAL Licensing. Many of them are named with the following format:

YYYY[-MM]_Doctype_Organization[_Notes] 
Examples:  2016_License_Cell-Press 2006-06_Correspondence_IEEE_2

Request: Could we create a script to have these documents renamed with the following convention?

Org-Name_YYYY_Doc-type[_Notes] 
Example: Institute-Of-Physics_2020-05_Correspondence_JP

For reference, these are the naming conventions we came up with during the FOLIO migration that we wanted to move toward for any new documents:
	1.	Use acronym/shortened organization name where possible 
	2.	Where piece of metadata is made up of multiple words, separate words by a dash -  
	3.	Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for acronyms, which are all caps) for maximum readability 
	4.	Document types: License, Correspondence, Invoice, Order form, Pricing, Renewals, Title list, System file, Consortium negotiation document (shorten to “Negotiation” in document name), Other 

I'd need to look at the rest that don't follow the older format and figure out how to rename those. COUNTER sheets can be left as is and will most likely be moved to another folder.

Catherine also has another folder in Drive with Licenses. Those do not follow a naming convention, but will need to be renamed as well. Not sure how to deal with those, but I'm ok to rename those a bit more manually if needed. Added Catherine to this request too.
