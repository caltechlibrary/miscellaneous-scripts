# Create a Google sheet listing folders in a Google drive of folders

The script in this folder can be used to produce a spreadsheet that lists the folders, subfolders, and optionally all files, in a given Google drive folder. The script and the approach originally came from the web page at <https://elgrito.witness.org/portfolio/google-list/> (saved copy in Internet Archive: <>).  A saved copy is also included as a PDF file in this directory.
