# Create a Google sheet listing folders in a Google drive of folders

The script in this folder can be used to produce a spreadsheet that lists the folders, subfolders, and optionally all files, in a given Google drive folder. The script and the approach originally came from the web page at <https://elgrito.witness.org/portfolio/google-list/> (saved copy in Internet Archive: <>).  A saved copy is also included as a PDF file in this directory.

The original script code came from a GitHub gist at <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mesgarpour/07317e81e9ee2b3f1699/raw/23833cef09a62a3d2cf56b4143bb3cf4dbb5b827/appsScript_ListFilesFolders_Mesgarpour.js>

I wrote instructions in the Library Confluence page at <https://caltechlibrary.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLD/pages/2629271592/List+all+folders+and+files+in+a+Google+drive+folder>
